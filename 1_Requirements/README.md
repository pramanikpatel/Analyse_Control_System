# Requirements
## Introduction
Control Systems are used almost everywhere in automation systems.Absolute Stabilty and Relative stability is very important factor to be considered while designing a control system. The designer at every moment of time needs the information of relative stabilty parameters like rise time,peak overshoot and peak time.Pluging in coefficients  of transfer function for calculating the above mentioned parameters is quiet difficult, when recursive approach of designing is taken. So taking this into consideration the program can help the designer to plug the coefficient of transfer function only once and the program will provide all the required parameter in one stroke.
 

## Research
Today many modern tools are available for analysing a control system.The most used are Matlab and octave.The advantage of this program over these tools is the space requirement. The above mentioned tools requires a whole bunch of software packages to be installed. So taking this into consideration this program could helps designers to get know important parameter of control system with an added advantage of its space reduction.

## Defining Our System
The system takes input as the coefficient of transfer function and outputs parameters like rise time,peak overshoot peak time.As most of the system are second oder in nature so the transfer function coefficient must be a second oder system.

# 4W&#39;s and 1&#39;H

## Who:

The developer will develop the program for the implementation

## What:

Coefficient of the transfer function is to be taken.

## When:

This problem of constantly needing the parameter is invoked whenever iterative apporach o design is used

## Where:

This problem is generally encountered in control system design sector.

## How:
A typical control system design approach may require 30-40 iterations so calculating these parameter for each iteration is quiet cumbersome.
